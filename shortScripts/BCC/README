haprad try4(aka v4) notes:

commented out a few lines in ihaprad.h ... search for "nate"
   -I only want the born CS for now, so removed the calculation of rad CS to save CPU time

eventually want to change h3.f and h4.f to Nick's model
   - pi+ and pi- !!
	*** this has been done!

improved rcdat_test.f


see /home/kjgroup/mysidis/shortScripts/BCC/datfiles/ for results

Binning:
since these are HAPRAD (fortran) results, indicies start at 1 not 0
filename gives z-PT2 bin number (e.g. go_pip_1_1.dat)
   90 z bins from 0.0-0.9
   100 PT2 bins 0.0-1.0 GeV^2
each file has 450,000 lines, one line for each x, QQ, phih bin (the value on each line is the Born CS)
   50 x bins from 0.1-0.6
   50 QQ bins from 1.0-5.0 GeV^2
   180 phih bins from -180-180 deg.
   (note: 50*50*180 = 450,000)
   first line is first x bin, first QQ bin, first phih bin 
   second line is first x bin, first QQ bin, second phih bin... etc.
