## histogram and data/MC files
The aforementioned histos/ directory is too large to keep in this repo. The "official" copy has been renamed to mysidis-histos/ and can be found in my home directory on the jlab farm (in a tar file). The files shouldn't change very often, but if they do change, this copy should be updated. A backup can also be found on my 2 TB "My Passport" hard drive. The data/MC files (in h22 format) are also on this hard drive (and of course the original bos files are on the farm in the official location).
